Q3:
Advantages of Chrome creating a new process for each tab:
1-Better isolation: Each tab runs in a separate process, which provides better isolation between tabs and prevents one tab from affecting another.
2-Improved security: Separate processes for each tab enhance security by limiting the damage that can be caused by malware or malicious web content.
3-Better resource management: Processes can be managed separately,
4-Improved scalability: Chrome can create new processes for new tabs, which allows the browser to scale better as the number of tabs increases.

Disadvantages of Chrome creating a new process for each tab:
1-Increased memory usage: Creating a new process for each tab can increase memory usage.
2-Higher startup time: Creating multiple processes can lead to increased startup time for the browser.
3-Increased complexity: Managing multiple processes can add to the complexity of the system.
4-Higher overhead: Creating and managing multiple processes can add to the overhead of the system.

Q4:
The OS recieves an interrupt from the keyboard that an "enter" is pressed then it startes the process that is called from the shell
